*Seattle-based REFLX Labs demonstrates its third-generation Bluetooth system and
developer kit to make shoes smarter at CES 2014.*

Using patent-pending advances in sensing technology, Boogio is a pair of wearable hardware devices designed
for new generation of applications in health, wellness, entertainment, and more. For example, Boogio can detect
balance by sensing a person's projected center gravity, which can be useful for a variety of applications, such as
athletic training and driving games.

This technology incorporates comfortable insoles with sensors that capture movement on each foot through
pressure sensors and 3D accelerometers. The Boogio developer system includes hardware and an SDK to get
developers and makers up to speed quickly when integrating Boogio with their own applications.

See a Boogio demo at the Living in Digital Times stage (booth #71201) in the Venetian at the following times:

 * Tuesday, January 7 - 3:15pm
 * Wednesday, January 8 - 3:30pm
 * Thursday, January 9 - 9:30am
