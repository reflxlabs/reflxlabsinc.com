*REFLX Labs debuts Boogio wearable technology at SIC 2013*

Make Your Move with Boogio technology and the Boogio developer kit.

**SEATTLE, WA &mdash; October 28th, 2013 &mdash;** Seattle-based
[REFLX Labs](http://reflxlabsinc.com) today announced that they will debut and
demonstrate [Boogio](http://boogio.com) wearable technology at this year's
[Seattle Interactive Conference](http://www.seattleinteractive.com/).

Using cutting-edge advances in sensing technology, Boogio is a pair of wearable
hardware devices designed for developers to build a new generation of apps for
health, wellness, entertainment, and more.

This technology incorporates comfortable insoles with sensors that capture
movement on each foot through pressure sensors and 3D accelerometers. Boogio
developer kits will include an SDK to get developers and makers up to speed more
quickly when integrating Boogio with their applications.

"Boogio is a wearable with tremendous value," says REFLX Labs co-founder and
CEO, Jose Torres. "The platform is very sensitive. Since it's worn on both feet,
it can detect subtle movements like a shift in balance, as well as strenuous
activities like running, jumping, or biking. This makes it both a device that
can be used in real-time to control software like apps or games, and a monitor
for physical activity and understanding physical mechanics. It's unobtrusive and
totally discrete."

**About REFLX Labs**

REFLX Labs was founded in Seattle in 2013 incubated at Qi2. Using patent-pending
technology, REFLX Labs works with the wearable technology developer community to
create consumer products for health, wellness, and entertainment.
