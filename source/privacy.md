# Privacy

REFLX Labs, Inc. ("REFLX Labs") is located at 19823 58th Place South, Suite 200 Kent, WA 98032. This Privacy Policy covers use of information collected by REFLX Labs, it's subsidiary websites such as www.boogio.com, and its related mobile app(s).

Our visitors' privacy is important to us, and we recognize the need to provide additional privacy protection for children on the REFLX Labs websites.  Our privacy practices and policies are guided by the United States' Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, as well as data privacy laws in the United States, local governing laws, and other applicable countries.  Visitors under the age of 18 are advised to always check with their parents or guardians before entering information on any website or mobile application and we encourage families to discuss their household guidelines regarding the online sharing of personal information.

To help ensure a rewarding online experience for our visitors, we provide you with this Privacy Policy that describes the information practices of the REFLX Labs website (www.reflxlabsinc.com), including how we collect, use and disclose personal information.

**1.	Computer Information Collected by REFLX Labs**

When visitors come to reflexlabsinc.com, we may automatically collect certain information from their computers or mobile devices, such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), the visitor's IP address, the web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome and Firefox), UDID (for certain mobile devices), information about the websites visited before and after visiting the Sites, the web pages and advertisements viewed and links clicked on within the REFLX Labs Sites, interactions with e-mail messages sent by REFLX Labs (e.g., links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), information collected through the use of unique identifiers such as cookies (see below), information regarding the Internet service provider, and other standard server log information ("Computer Information").

Additionally, we may use cookies, web beacons, tokens or similar technologies (collectively referred to as "Tracking Technologies") on the REFLX Labs Sites.


By visiting a Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to set and access Cookies on your device and track your activities and your use of a Site through these Tracking Technologies and Identifiers and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you.


**2.	How We Use, Disclose, and Store the Information We Collect**

In addition to the purposes described in Section 1, we may actively collect and use email addresses and user names to track usage and to ensure users are following the site's Terms of Use. In addition, we may use an email address and user name to ban a user temporarily or permanently from the REFLX Labs websites if that user engages in inappropriate conduct on the site. We may also use email addresses and user names to enable parents to review PII that the children have submitted to the REFLX Labs websites and to provide notification regarding the site, such as any future amendments to this Privacy Policy. We also may use information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services.
We may disclose information where we are required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena, or where we disclose information to data processors who act on our behalf (service providers or other group companies who provide support for the operations of our websites and who do not use or disclose the information for any other purpose). To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose PII in response to a law enforcement agency's or other public agency's (including schools or children services) request or if we feel that such disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our websites, protect the security or integrity of our websites, or enable us to take precautions against liability.
If we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of our assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may transfer PII to a third party as part of that transaction, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

**3.	Security**

The security of your personal information is paramount to us. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online. When you enter sensitive information, such as your credit card number, or our membership subscription form, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

Wherever your personal information is transferred, stored or processed by us, we will take reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy of your personal information. Additionally, when using or disclosing personal information transferred from the European Union or Switzerland to the United States, we abide by the Safe Harbor Principles as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, use standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission, adopt other means under relevant law for ensuring adequate safeguards, or obtain your consent. We also apply the substantive requirements of the Safe Harbor Principles when transferring personal information from Australia.

**4.	Financial Information**

Any credit card, as well as any other personal financial, information is not stored by REFLX Labs, and, instead, is stored by our payments processing vendor for the purpose of processing payments made to REFLX Labs and for fraud prevention purposes. That information is safeguarded with appropriate security, and it will not be used for other purposes. Furthermore, our payments processing vendor has agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal and financial information it obtains from the REFLX Labs websites, and only to use this information on our behalf. Our financial institution is bound by all applicable privacy laws relating to the provision of financial services.

**5.	Access to Information, and Objection to Information Collection and Retention**

Please contact us as provided in Section 7 if you would like to access the PII that we have collected online from you or your child, correct factual errors in such information, request to have this information deleted, or request that we no longer collect or maintain such information. .
